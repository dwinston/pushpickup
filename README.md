# Push Pickup

A passion project by [Donny Winston](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/donny-winston/8/951/552) and Stewart McCoy [@stewartmccoy](http://twitter.com/stewartmccoy).

This is an open source project and we'd love to talk with you if you're interested in contributing. Be sure to check out our issue tracker and see more below.

Stewart would love if you emailed him at mccoy dot stewart at gmail dot com.

For more background on the motivation for this project, read: [A better way to organize pickup sports](http://stewartmccoy.com/a-better-way-to-organize-pickup-sports/)

## Development

This project uses [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) and [Meteorite](http://oortcloud.github.io/meteorite/). To start hacking,

    curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
    # fork this repo if you want to contribute commits, but you can also just...
    git clone https://github.com/dwinston/pushpickup.git
    cd pushpickup
    # Install nodejs first if `which npm` returns nothing
    npm install -g meteorite # or `sudo -H npm install -g meteorite` if permissions error
    mrt install # Meteorite installs third-party smart packages
    meteor --settings ./config/development/settings.json # load example data for development

Load `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser and play around.

The `devel` branch is the "stable" edge, from which feature branches (such as `new-mobile-rough`) are created and merged, and corresponds to what is (or should be) up at [pushpickup.meteor.com](http://pushpickup.meteor.com)

The `master` branch corresponds to what is (or should be) up at [pushpickup.com](http://pushpickup.com).

If you have an issue with the code, please [let us know](https://github.com/dwinston/pushpickup/issues/new). :)
