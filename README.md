## Development

This project uses [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) an awesome open-source platform for developing web apps. To start hacking,

    git clone https://github.com/pushpickup/pushpickup.git
    cd pushpickup
    sudo bash ./config/development/env.setup

Load `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser and play around.

The `devel` branch is the "stable" edge, from which feature branches (such as `new-mobile-rough`) are created and merged, and corresponds to what is (or should be) up at [pushpickup.meteor.com](http://pushpickup.meteor.com)

The `master` branch corresponds to what is (or should be) up at [pushpickup.com](http://pushpickup.com).

If you have an issue with the code, please [let us know](https://github.com/pushpickup/pushpickup/issues/new) :)
